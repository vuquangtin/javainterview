 *		 long l = 1;

 * }
 * 
 * The code:
 * 
 * a) It doesn't compile line 3, since 1 is int and cannot be put in a byte.
 * b) It doesn't compile line 4, since 1 is long and cannot be put in a int.
 * c) It doesn't compile line 5, since 1 is int and cannot be put in a long.
 * d) It doesn't compile line 6, since 1.0 is double and cannot be put in a float. (x)
 * e) All lines compile.
