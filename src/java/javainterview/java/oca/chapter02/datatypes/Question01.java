 * and run the following code:
 * 
 * public static void main(String[] args) {
 *	int
 *	age
 *	= 100;
 *	System.out.println(age);
 * }
 * 
 * a) The code doesn't compile: errors from the line that define a variable of type int.
 * b) The code doesn't compile: the variable age wasn't initialized, but was used in System.out.println.
 * c) The code compiles and prints 0.
 * d) The code compiles and prints 100. (x)
