	/*-
	 * comments aren’t executable code, you can place them anywhere. Comments
	 * make your code easier to read. There are three types of comments in Java:
	 * 1.- single-line comment: A single-line comment begins with two slashes.
	 * Anything you type after that on the same line is ignored by the compiler.
	 * 
	 * 2.- multiple-line comment:(also known as a multiline comment) People
	 * often type an asterisk ( *) at the beginning of each line of a multiline
	 * comment to make it easier to read, but you don’t have to.
	 * 
	 * 3.- Javadoc comment: This comment is similar to a multiline comment
	 * except it starts with /** This special syntax tells the Javadoc tool to
	 * pay attention to the comment. Javadoc comments have a specific structure
	 * that the Javadoc tool knows how to read. You won’t see a Javadoc comment
	 * on the exam—just remember it exists so you can read up on it online when
	 * you start writing programs for others to use.
