public class I_A_BenefitsOfJava {
    /*-
    Java has some key benefits that you’ll need to know for the exam:
    - Object Oriented: Java is an object-oriented language, which means all code is defined in classes and most of those classes can be instantiated into objects.
    We’ll discuss this more throughout the book. Many languages before Java were procedural, which meant there were routines or methods but no classes.
    Another common approach is "functional programming".
    Java allows for functional programming within a class, but object oriented is still the main organization of code.
    - Encapsulation: Java supports "access modifiers" to protect data from unintended access and modification.
    Most people consider encapsulation to be an aspect of object-oriented languages. Since the exam objectives call attention to it specifically, so do we.
    - Platform Independent: Java is an interpreted language because it gets compiled to bytecode.
    A key benefit is that Java code gets compiled once rather than needing to be recompiled for different operating systems.
    This is known as “write once, run everywhere.” On the OCP exam, you’ll learn that it is possible to write code that does not run every where. For example,
    you might refer to a file in a specific directory. If you get asked on the OCA exam, the answer is that the same class files run everywhere.
    - Robust: One of the major advantages of Java over C++ is that it prevents memory leaks.
    Java manages memory on its own and does garbage collection automatically. Bad memory management in C++ is a big source of errors in programs.
    - Simple: Java was intended to be simpler than C++. In addition to eliminating pointers, it got rid of operator overloading. In C++, you could write a + b
    and have it mean almost anything.
    - Secure: Java code runs inside the JVM. This creates a sandbox that makes it hard for Java code to do evil things to the computer it is running on.
