## Spring MVC flow in deep
summury flow: 

- 1. start tomcat
- 2. register dispatcher servlet in web.xml
- 3.
 - 3.1 dispatcher servlet load WebApplicationContext from dispatcher-servlet.xml
 - 3.2 WebApplicationContext includes instantiation/wiring configuration; Special beans in WebApplicationContext: HandlerMapping, ViewResolver, HandlerExceptionResolver, LocaleResolver, MultipartResolver ...
- 4. tomcat server startup successfully
- 5. any request -> HandlerMapping -> automatically looks for @RequestMapping annotations on all @Controller beans


### 1. start tomcat server

### 2. read code in implementation class of WebApplicationInitializer to register dispatcher servlets, 
or else can read ```web.xml``` to register instead of ```WebApplicationInitializer```

```java
public class MyWebAppInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer {

    @Override
    public void onStartup(ServletContext container) {
      XmlWebApplicationContext appContext = new XmlWebApplicationContext();
      appContext.setConfigLocation("/WEB-INF/dispatcher-servlet.xml");
      ServletRegistration.Dynamic dispatcher =
        container.addServlet("dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(appContext));
      dispatcher.setLoadOnStartup(1);
      dispatcher.addMapping("/");
    }
}
```

equivalent to web.xml:
 
```
<web-app>
 <servlet>
   <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
   <servlet-class>
     org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
   </servlet-class>
   <init-param>
     <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
     <param-value>/WEB-INF/dispatcher-servlet.xml</param-value>
   </init-param>
   <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
 </servlet>

 <servlet-mapping>
   <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
   <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>
 </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
```

### 3. run DispatcherServlet class, each DispatcherServlet has its own WebApplicationContext -> XMLWebApplicationContext (AnnotationConfigApplicationContext in case of springboot)

XMLWebApplicationContext metadata is loaded from /WEB-INF/dispatcher-servlet.xml as above example. we declare Bean instantiation/wiring in dispatcher-servlet.xml for ApplicationContext

dispatcher-servlet.xml:

```
<context:component-scan base-package="controller" />

<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">
	<property name="prefix">
		<value>/WEB-INF/jsp/</value>
	</property>
	<property name="suffix">
		<value>.jsp</value>
	</property>
</bean>

<mvc:interceptors>
	<bean class="intercepter.MyHandlerInterceptor"></bean>
</mvc:interceptors>

```

Special bean types in the WebApplicationContext:

- HandlerMapping: Maps incoming requests to handlers and a list of pre- and post-processors 
- HandlerAdapter: Helps the DispatcherServlet to invoke a handler mapped to a request regardless of the handler is actually invoked. For example, invoking an annotated controller requires resolving various annotations. Thus the main purpose of a HandlerAdapter is to shield the DispatcherServlet from such details.
- HandlerExceptionResolver: Maps exceptions to views. Example: error page
- ViewResolver: maps view names to actual views
- LocaleResolver: offer internationalized views
- ThemeResolver: offer personalized layouts
- MultipartResolver: 	Parses multi-part requests for example to support processing file uploads from HTML forms.
- FlashMapManager: Stores and retrieves the "input" and the "output" FlashMap that can be used to pass attributes from one request to another, usually across a redirect.

Important beans: HandlerMapping, HandlerExceptionResolver, ViewResolver

### 4. HandlerMapping: 
In previous versions of Spring, users were required to define one or more HandlerMapping beans in the web application context to map incoming web requests to appropriate handlers.
With the introduction of annotated controllers, you generally don't need to do that because the RequestMappingHandlerMapping automatically looks for @RequestMapping annotations on all @Controller beans

Spring's handler mapping mechanism includes handler interceptors, which are useful when you want to apply specific functionality to certain requests.
Interceptors located in the handler mapping must implement HandlerInterceptor and override 3 methods:

- preHandle: is called before the actual handler is executed
- postHandle:  is called after the handler is executed
- afterCompletion:  is called after the complete request has finished

For example: request to display homePage.jsp: client's request -> preHandle -> method with @RequestMapping in Controller -> postHandle -> homePage.jsp -> afterCompletion -> render homePage to client

### 5. ViewResolver:
